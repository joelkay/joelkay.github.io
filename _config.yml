      description: During my time at school I was able to work on some IT based projects. Some of these included, Invoice handling(excel) and an Automatic Schedule/Organiser also based on excel. I assessed the issues at hand, where there was a lot of time wasted manually entering values into excel spreadsheets. I suggested an automated system based on heavy macro usage which was taken well and has drastically reduced the amount of time it takes to have their spreadsheets generated with the relevant data.
